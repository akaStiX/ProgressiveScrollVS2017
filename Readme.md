This is a fork of [ProgressiveScroll](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=freaksken.ProgressiveScroll) updated to work with VS 2017 (it fixes annoying exception thrown, when starting Visual Studio project). It replaces the scrollbar with a graphic representation of the code.

**Features:**

* Double clicking highlights the selected word in the editor and the scrollbar.
* Pressing Escape clears the highlights.
* Coloring options for whitespace, comments, strings, file changes, highlights, bookmarks, breakpoints and errors. These can be found in Tools > Options > Fonts and Colors.
* Adjustable width (This and other settings can be found under Tools > Options > Progressive Scroll).
* Uses the space that is usually wasted in the bottom right corner of the editor (only in VS2010) and hides the splitter control in the top right corner.

**Warning!** Does not work well with word wrap.

Changelog:
* 0.9.0 
  * Updated to support Visual Studio 2017
* 0.9.1
  * Updated to incorporate compatibility with new releases of Visual Studio 2017, including Enterprise Edition

  
Support for Visual Studio versions older than 2017 is deprecated, please use original plugin [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=freaksken.ProgressiveScroll)
